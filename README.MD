# Proxy Rabbit

## Overview

Two repos are required for this project:
https://github.com/SM10/proxy-rabbit
https://github.com/SM10/proxy-rabbit-api

Proxy Rabbit is a social media website aimed at connecting people around the world. It aims to provide a platform where people can freely ask and offer their local specialties and region-exclusive products to each other.

### Problem

Did you know that Coffee Crisp is only available in Canada? Despite being an amazing commercial success and a widely popular, it isn't sold overseas or even in America.

There are tons of products like these. Region-exclusive specialties that are unknown to the world. Proxy Rabbit provides a platform for people to learn about and buy these products from and for each other.

### User Profile

Proxy Rabbit is planned to be aimed at young adults, and while a mobile version will be available, it will focus primarily on a tablet and desktop experience.

### Features

Proxy Rabbit will provide 2 ways to search for a proxy, or another user from that region who will help purchase and mail a desired product. The first is by country, and the second will be by popular products.

Once the user has found a proxy, they can send them a message through Proxy Rabbit's built-in messenging system.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

Front End:
React
SASS

Back End:
Node.js
Express
MySQL
Knex
Nodemon
Socket.IO
Passport.js

### APIs

No external APIs will be used for this app.

### Sitemap

The following pages will be necessary:

### Data

The following tables will be implemented

Products table:
id
name
image_url
country_id (foreign key mapped to country table)

User table:
id
email
first_name
last_name
password
country_id (foreign key mapped to country table)

Message Master table. This table will manage all the tables related to messages:
room_id (primary key)
user_one (foreign key mapped to user table)
user_two (foreign key mapped to user table)

Message Table Sample. A new table will be generated each time a user messages someone they have not messaged before.
id
room_id (foreign key mapped to message master table's primary key)
from (foreign key mapped to user.id on user table)
to (foreign key mapped to user.id on user table)
message
timestamp

Sessions. A sessions table as required by connect-session-knex dependency

### Endpoints

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.

January 19 - 22: Complete development and testing api requests.
January 22 - 25: Complete development of components and styling of front end.
January 26 - 30: Implementation of real-time messaging through Server.IO
January 31 - Feb 3: Implementation of Nice-to-haves

## Nice-to-haves

Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Under nice-to-haves, you can list any additional features you may complete if you have extra time, or after finishing.

1. A rating system where users can rate each other as proxies.
2. Form for user to submit new region-exclusive products.
3. Expected price of products.
